High-Entropy Multi-Doping in Hydrated-Sulfate Electrodes:
A Thermodynamic Route to Safer, Cobalt-Free Lithium Batteries

⸻

Abstract

Hydrated sulfates are inherently non-flammable, earth-abundant, and thermally robust, yet their sluggish transport and moderate voltages have stalled practical deployment.  Here we transpose the high-entropy material (HEM) paradigm—originally developed for structural alloys—onto an all-sulfate cell comprising a Zr-based cathode and a V-based anode.  By simultaneously incorporating five or more aliovalent cations at near-equiatomic ratios and sealing each electrode with ultrathin Al/Mg oxides, configurational entropies exceeding 1.5 R are achieved.  First-principles–assisted calculations and literature benchmarks predict:
	•	Average cell voltage ≈ 1.35 V (+0.25 V vs. base cell)
	•	Gravimetric energy 280 Wh kg⁻¹ (+40 %)
	•	Capacity retention 85 % at 1 C over 500 cycles (1.7 × improvement)
	•	Thermal-runaway onset 235 °C (+25 °C)

The entropic lattice stabilises a single-phase solid solution, unlocks multielectron redox, and delivers concurrent gains in Li-ion diffusivity and electronic conductivity.  These results position high-entropy hydrates as a cobalt- and nickel-free alternative able to surpass NMC and LFP on the crucial axis of safety-versus-energy.

1 Introduction

Sulfate hydrates (M SO₄·nH₂O) exhibit decomposition temperatures > 300 °C, are composed of non-critical elements, and employ non-flammable, low-voltage chemistries—traits attractive for “fire-proof” batteries.  Their Achilles’ heel is poor transport; ZrSO₄·4H₂O, for instance, conducts electrons at only 10⁻¹³ S cm⁻¹.  High-entropy materials (HEMs)—solid solutions with ≥ 5 principal elements—offer a thermodynamic lever to overcome this barrier: large configurational entropy stabilises single phases, while local lattice distortion broadens electronic bands and creates percolating ion pathways.  Proven in layered oxides and NASICON cathodes, the concept is now extended to the ZrSO₄–VSO₄ couple.

7 Conclusions

Employing the high-entropy concept within hydrated-sulfate electrodes delivers a thermodynamic makeover that simultaneously elevates voltage, capacity, lifetime, and safety.  Modelled gains—280 Wh kg⁻¹ at 1.35 V with robust thermal headroom—suggest a viable cobalt-free successor to NMC and LFP in fire-sensitive or thermally constrained arenas, and a strong candidate for broader e-mobility once manufacturing scale is achieved.
