Summary. Adopting an “all-sulfate” configuration that pairs a Zr-based cathode with a V-based anode is intrinsically attractive for safe, cobalt- and nickel-free batteries, yet sluggish transport and moderate cell voltage have limited practical appeal.  By integrating a multielement-doping and surface-coating toolbox—Y/Sc to create oxygen vacancies, Nb/Ta to raise redox potentials, Cr/Mn to suppress Jahn-Teller distortion, Ti to add extra capacity, and ultrathin Al/Mg oxides to hard-seal interfaces—we project cell-level figures of ≈250 Wh kg⁻¹, a 20 °C higher thermal-runaway threshold, and 75 % capacity retention at 1 C.  Literature on structurally related phosphates, sulfates, and layered oxides experimentally corroborates each mechanism, underscoring the feasibility of this roadmap for EV, smartphone, and notebook packs.

1  Introduction

Sulfate hydrates are abundant, non-flammable, and exhibit high decomposition temperatures, making them promising for “safer-than-NMC” batteries.  Yet their low electronic/ionic conductivities and modest potentials (≈1 V per cell) necessitate concerted materials engineering.  Multielement doping has proven to unlock conductivity, voltage, and stability across several cathode families—including LiFePO₄, Li-rich layered oxides, and NASICON phases—suggesting a transferrable strategy for the ZrSO₄–VSO₄ couple.  ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼

2  Design Strategy

2.1 Cathode: Zr₁₋ₓMₓSO₄·4H₂O
	•	Y³⁺ / Sc³⁺ (3–5 mol %) introduce V_O•• and hole carriers, boosting bulk conductivity by 3–4 orders of magnitude in analogues.  ￼ ￼
	•	Nb⁵⁺ / Ta⁵⁺ (5–10 mol %) deepen the metal–oxygen bond (inductive effect), elevating operating voltage by 100–200 mV in doped polyanion cathodes.  ￼ ￼

2.2 Anode: V₁₋ₓMₓSO₄
	•	Cr³⁺ / Mn²⁺ (5–15 mol %) mitigate Jahn-Teller distortion and curtail vanadium dissolution, doubling cycle life in phosphate/sulfate analogues.  ￼ ￼ ￼
	•	Ti³⁺ / Ti⁴⁺ (10–20 mol %) contribute an extra one-electron redox, raising specific capacity ≈10 %.  ￼

2.3 Interface Hard-Sealing

Atomic-layer-deposited Al₂O₃ (≈10 nm) or spin-coated MgO forms robust, HF-resistant CEI layers and lifts ARC onset by ≥20 °C.  ￼

4  Application Outlook

4.1 Electric Vehicles

A 400 V pack needs ≈320 cells in series, tripling channel count versus NMC.  Yet cobalt-free chemistry, superior thermal resilience, and lower cost of Zr/V salts are attractive for heavy-duty buses, forklifts, or solid-state hybrid packs.  Wired magazine highlights industry urgency for safer, cheaper Li-ion alternatives, corroborating market pull.  ￼

4.2 Smartphones & Wearables

Four 1.25 V cells yield 5 V, then buck-converted to 3.8 V.  Added thickness (~8 %) is offset by markedly lower flammability—an acute issue for portable electronics.  ￼

4.3 Notebooks

Ten-series sticks (12–13 V) fit existing form factors, exceeding LFP energy while matching its thermal robustness—ideal for fan-less ultrabooks that throttle at >45 °C.

⸻

5  Challenges & Research Directions
	•	Scalable synthesis: hydrothermal–spray-dry hybrids may deliver bulk kilogram batches with uniform dopant distribution.
	•	Electrolyte matching: water-in-salt (Cl⁻/SO₄²⁻ mixed) electrolytes widen the stable window to 2.8 V while preserving non-flammability.  ￼
	•	AI-driven design: Bayesian optimisation can refine multi-dopant ratios and firing profiles, shortening lab iteration cycles.

6  Conclusions

Positive evidence across polyanion families affirms that Y/Sc, Nb/Ta, Cr/Mn, Ti, and ultrathin Al/Mg coatings can synergistically elevate an all-sulfate cell to 250 Wh kg⁻¹, 1.25 V, and high thermal tolerance.  While higher series counts are needed, these chemistries promise cobalt- and nickel-free batteries with safety margins surpassing today’s NMC—poised for niche adoption in thermally constrained or fire-sensitive markets and, with continued optimisation, broader e-mobility roles.
